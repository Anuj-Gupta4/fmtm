# Welcome To The Field Mapping Wiki!!

**What is ONE thing all the greatest solutions out there have in common?**

They never forget the people they are building for (^^)

So who are we building field mapping solutions for? In short, we build solutions for:

- The **Field Mapping Manager** (The person who coordinates field mapping)
- The **Field Mapper** (The person who collects data)
- The **Validator** (The person who checks the quality of data collected)

Below is an overview of the user flow of the **Field Mapper**, the **Mapping Coordinator / Field Mapping Manager** and the **Validator**.

[Click here](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPX4XLcI=/?moveToWidget=3458764534814634286&cot=14) to see an overview of who you are building for, which actions they take and some ideas for solutions!
