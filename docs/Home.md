# Welcome to the field mapping wiki

**What is ONE thing all the greatest solutions out there have in common?**
They never forget the people they are building for (^^)

So who are we building field mapping solutions for? In short:

## The field mapping manager (coordinating field mapping)
The field mapping manager is responsible for coordinating field mapping
activities, ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the data
collected, and managing the data itself. This involves a number of key
steps, including:

- ***Planning:*** The field mapping manager must develop a clear plan
for the data collection process, including identifying key areas of
focus and establishing timelines and targets.

- ***Recruitment:*** The field mapping manager must recruit and train
field mappers, ensuring that they have the necessary skills and
expertise to collect accurate and high-quality data.

- ***Coordination:*** The field mapping manager must coordinate the activities
of the field mappers, ensuring that they are working together
effectively and efficiently.

## The field mapper (collecting data)
The field mapper is responsible for collecting data in the field. To
ensure the success of the field mapper, we must consider a number of key
factors. These include:

- ***Ease of use:*** The field mapper must be able to easily and efficiently
collect data, without requiring extensive training or technical
expertise.

- ***Accessibility:*** The field mapper must be able to access and
collect data from a wide range of environments, including remote or
hard-to-reach locations.

- ***Data quality:*** The field mapper must be able to ensure the accuracy and
completeness of the data they collect, as well as identify and address
any errors or issues that arise.

## The validator (quality checking the data)
The validator is responsible for quality checking the data collected by
the field mapper, ensuring that it is accurate, complete, and free from
errors. The validator faces a number of challenges and issues, including:

- ***Incomplete or inaccurate data:*** The validator must identify and
address any data that is incomplete, inaccurate, or otherwise flawed.

- ***Conflicting data:*** The validator may encounter data that
conflicts with other data sources, requiring them to identify and
resolve any discrepancies.

- ***Data validation protocols:*** The validator must adhere to strict
validation protocols and guidelines, ensuring that the data meets a high
level of quality and accuracy.

Below is an overview of the user flow of the field mapper, the mapping coordinator and the validator.
