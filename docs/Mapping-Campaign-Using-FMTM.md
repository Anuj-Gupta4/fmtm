# A tutorial on how to use FMTM for a mapping campaign

A mapping campaign typically refers to an organized effort to collect data and create maps of a particular geographic area or feature. This may involve using various mapping technologies, such as GPS, satellite imagery, or crowdsourced data, to gather information about the area of interest.

Mapping campaigns can be carried out for a variety of purposes, such as disaster response and recovery, environmental conservation, urban planning, or social and political activism. They often involve collaboration between various organizations, including government agencies, non-profit groups, and volunteers.

Once the data is collected, it is typically analyzed and processed to create detailed maps that can be used for a variety of purposes, such as identifying areas of need, planning infrastructure and development projects, or understanding the impact of environmental changes on the landscape.

### An Overview of the FMTM(Field Mapping Tasking Manager) in relations with HOT(Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team) and OSM(Open Street Mapping)

The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is a non-profit organization that uses open mapping data to support humanitarian and disaster response efforts around the world. The Field Mapping Task Manager (FMTM) is one of the tools that HOT uses to coordinate and manage mapping projects.

In the context of HOT, FMTM is a software tool that helps project managers to organize and manage mapping tasks, assign those tasks to volunteers, and track their progress. The tool includes features for collaborative editing, data validation, and error detection, ensuring that the data collected by volunteers is accurate and reliable.

FMTM is designed to be used in conjunction with OpenStreetMap (OSM), a free and open-source map of the world that is created and maintained by volunteers. When volunteers use FMTM to collect data, that data is typically uploaded to OSM, where it is used to create more detailed and accurate maps of the affected area.

Overall, the FMTM tool is an important component of HOT's efforts to support disaster response and humanitarian efforts around the world. By coordinating mapping activities and ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the data collected by volunteers, FMTM helps to provide critical information that can be used to support decision-making and improve the effectiveness of humanitarian efforts.
